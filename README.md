# LosslessImageRotation
Matlab function to rotate images without quality loss. No interpolation methods are used for the rotation. Furthermore, the rotation can be applied to image stacks and is vectorized to support rotating as many images as memory can hold.
This function has only been tested with grayscale images; the next step is to apply this to color images for further functionality.
